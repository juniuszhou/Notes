####  http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/trunk/zookeeperOver.html
ZooKeeper is a centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming,
providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services.

it is developed in java.

zk put most of data in memory, so it need machine with enough memory.

zab protocol. zookeeper atomic broadcast.
it is different with Paxos, the protocol used by chubby.


## concepts about consistency.
ACID atomic, isolation,
CAP consistency, available, partition.
BASE

#### major concepts.
Leader: launch voting and update system
Learner (follower): receive request from client and participate voting.
Learner (observer): receive request but not participate voting.
Client: the application need HA.

1. client can connect to any server of three types. but the view it got should be the same.
2.

#### Data model.
basically, it is a tree similar to unix file system. and each app can create a node under root.
different with file system, the directory node can hold some data.

we can create/update/delete node and add child for this node.
data are time stamped and support permission control.

znode include version and update time.



## temporary node
## ordered node

#### znode watch
client can set zone watch, then if znode updated, client will get message from zk.
the watch just triggered once.


#### ACL
ACL for access control. there is no user/group concept in zk. ACL set some user ID set.
also assign rights for those sets. and the rights not recursive, means is not applied
to its child nodes automatically.
CREATE???????
READ??????????????
WRITE????????
DELETE???????
ADMIN????????


#### consistence guarantee.

#### Java interface
org.apache.zookeeper and org.apache.zookeeper.data

there are two threads (event thread and IO thread) when create a zk object.
IO thread use java NIO mode. non blocking.

#### scala interface
https://github.com/twitter/util/tree/master/util-zk/src/main/scala/com/twitter/zk
twitter provide open source wrapper for zookeeper.


#### theory about zk

#### command of zk
3.1. ??ZK??:        bin/zkServer.sh start
3.2. ??ZK????:  bin/zkServer.sh status
3.3  ??ZK??:        bin/zkServer.sh stop
3.4. ??ZK??:        bin/zkServer.sh restart
3.5  ?????          zkCli.sh -server 127.0.0.1:2181
3.6  ????? ls /
3.7  ?? testnode????????"zz"         create /zk/testnode "zz"
3.8  ??????  get /zk/testnode
3.9  ??????  set /zk/testnode abc
4.0  ????      delete /zk/testnode




#### Terms
ACL access control list

#### sub
You can subscribe change happened in zookeeper. then you get notice
and update accordingly.
