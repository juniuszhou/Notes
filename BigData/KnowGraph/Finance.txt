why more knowledge graph in finance.

1. in real society, each person has lots of connection. especially in finance.
because real society is a monetary society. connection appears when come to finance.

in data mode of shen zhou, the connection just between customer and driver and company.
it is very simple.

in shen zhou, I collect each people's activity in our platform. but never use connection 
between person and person. actually, to address false contract, I try to use graphx to 
get the connection between customer and driver. it is kind of application of knowledge graph.

but in finance area, It is seems more strong for connection. since finance society.
and customer usually input more information about connection. or we crawler more info about connection.



# in real work. why knowledge graph.

so many different data to describe a person. contacts, call / sms records.
data from banks. shopping in taobao and jd. 

there is difficult to get the feature from those data.
if use those data seperately, the connections are ignored. and actually, those data is very 
important for risk control. so knowledge graph critical.
