## beeline
beeline is created to replace cli.
it cooperate with hive server 2.

hiveserver2 is thrift server. beeline must connect to it.
and normal cli use driver directly.


 ./bin/hiveserver2

 ./bin/beeline

!connect jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000


## advantage.
1. the format of output is much better than old cli.

## seems we can't use beeline to load data.
