# serialization problem.
if need input/output to hdfs, then you must choose writable format.
but internla usage, you need seriable. then shuffle is possible.

# connection reset and metadata can be got problem
if you set too many cores in an executor, or too many executor.
then too many threads compete for disk IO and network IO.
it will let the whole performance down.
so reduce the parallelism could make program end correctly.
also make program faster.
