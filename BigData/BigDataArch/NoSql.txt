#### three theory about NoSql
1. memcached in-memory index can be scalable and distributed.
2. dynamo eventual consistency. read not aways newest and write will be propagated eventually.
3. big table. persistent storage can be scaled to thousands of nodes.

horizontal scaling, scale out by add more node
OLTP online transaction processing

NoSql key feature sharing nothing.

BASE basically available, soft state, eventually consistency
ACID atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability.

CAP consistency, available, partition

data model ,  tuple , document, extensible record, object
data store, key-value, document, extensible record




## strong consistence , weak consistence and eventual consistence.
if the following reader can see all the impact of before writer, it is strong.
if part of writer can be seen, it is weak.
if after a while, the reader can see. it is eventual consistency.
