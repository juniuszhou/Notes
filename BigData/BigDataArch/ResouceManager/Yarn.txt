#### problems of Map Reduce 1.0
1. coder must map reduce model and like assembly language
2. job tracker as center for resource allocation and scheduler.

## Arch
RM resource manager
AM application manager. AM can increase decrease needed resource according to computing.
NM node manager
container the unit of allocation. logic combination of memory and cpu.
CLC container launch context, used to describe the containers abstracted in YARN.

## RM
expose two interface
1. client submit application
2. AM negotiate with RM about resource.

RM just give the job or its head , application manager the resource.
so avoid to manage the all map reduce tasks like before.


## AM
AM is the head of an application, and coordinate with NM to trigger executor
run at node. itself also run as a task in node.
For spark, there are cluster mode and client mode. the AM can run at driver machine.
