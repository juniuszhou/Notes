####
it is implemented with c++ about 10K line code.
for internal message, Mesos use libprocess, which is c++ actor like lib.

use linux namespace for process isolation.
use zookeeper for status management of active Mesos master and standby Mesos master.

two level schedule mechanism.
1. mesos master and mesos slave. slave report resource to frameworks.
2. framework for second level schedule. give the resource to job.
3. after framework accept the offer from all slaves' resource allocation.
then framework will cooperate with mesos master to run job in executors.



DRF dominant resource fairness.
the algorithm to allocate resource in frameworks.




## the problem like memory fragment.
if several machine just one cpu available, we can't combine
those computing ability.





## difference with yarn
1. mesos framework decide if accept the offer. yarn itself decide if run the application.
2. yarn for static partitioning, mesos for dynamic partitioning.
3. there is a project myriad make the yarn run on top of mesos.
