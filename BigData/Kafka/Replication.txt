#### kafka also need zk for HA  http://developer.51cto.com/art/201501/464491_1.htm
it may put offset into zk for HA. maybe for each topic, each partition.
kafka broker keep heartbeat with zk.

replication can be configured in server.properties.
in default, replication is 1 . so each partition had the only leader.
and all read/write is done in leader.

we can set replication for each topic.




#### re-balance.
for consumers, if one dead or a new one join. then kafka need re-assign the partition
to different consumer.
