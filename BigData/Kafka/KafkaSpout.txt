#### implementation of kafka spout.
1. the spout use zk for fault tolerance. it record the ack number into zk
periodically and get it from zk after restart.
2. each spout instance responsible for several partition of a topic.
depends on the number of partition and spout parallelism.
3. there is retry mechanism in spout if the message handle failed.
   and also if continuous fail, then retry interval will be added exponentially.

4. in spout next tuple, kafka spout will get one message from each partition.
and then emit. so for one partition, the order can be guaranteed.

5. config value is hard coded in KafkaConfig.java. so you must re-compile if you
need update parameter 's value.
6.
