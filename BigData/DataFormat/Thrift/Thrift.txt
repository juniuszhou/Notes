#### Thrift is remote procedure call framework.
opened by Facebook, can support different language.

the basic idea is client and server use the IDL to define the interface.
then we can use thrift tool to generate interface file, such as Iface.java.
then server need implement the interface and listen in the fixed port.

client side to connect the server and get handler to call method.

the transport layer is raw socket.

the data stream format is configurable, you can choose binary, JSON , xml and so on.

#### types of server
1. simple, block I/O
2. thread pool server, multiple thread but block I?O
3. non block server.

#### protocol
binary or text.

#### How to develop thrift application
1. download thrift and install it
2. define the interface file then use thrift to generate source code directly.
command:
thrift gen java simple.thrift
