Row group. split the data according to row.

for each row group, within row group. each column is stored separately.
each column is a leaf in the whole record structures. even the record is very
complex and including embedded structure. that's why at the beginning of each page,
there is schema which include the definition level to describe the path in the tree.

#### the size of page is about 1M after encoding. because each column data 's type
is the same so high efficient encoding algorithm can be used. 1M can store a lot of data.

and you can set it via parquet.page.size and parquet.block.size.
