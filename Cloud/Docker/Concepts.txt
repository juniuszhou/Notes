## underlying tech
namespace
 pid, net, pic, mnt, uts namespace
isolate the resource at OS level

control groups
share hardware resource

union file system
share file, most of files are immutable

container format
put namespace, cgroup and ufs into container.
libcontainer already replace lxc-container.


## LXC and libcontainer. and why libcontainer replace LXC.
LXC wrap the complicated method provided by linux kernel.
make the container creation much easier.

Linux Containers (LXC) was used before docker 1.8 as one execution driver by docker,
and offered a userspace interface for the Linux kernel containment features. It is very specific to Linux

libcontainer written by go. it is not depend on LXC anymore.
it call method in kernel of linux directly. because of it provide interface for container management.
so it make docker can run other platform. if we implement libcontainer's interface.

libcontainer (now opencontainers/runc) is an abstraction, in order to support a wider range of isolation
technologies as described in this article

## apparmor
AppArmor 是一个类似于selinux 的东东，主要的作用是设置某个可执行程序的访问控制权限，可以限制程序 读/写某个目录/文件，打开/读/写网络端口等等
# check armor status  /etc/apparmor.d/
sudo apparmor_status


## layer
the image is composed of file layers. each layer is immutable.
for each container, just very thin, small, top layer is mutable.

for old version each layer has UUID, it is a hash code.
since 1.10, the code for each layer is secure content hash.

so old version's image need migration after upgrade to 1.10
and docker daemon may stop response since it need compute hash based on whole
layer content.

sudo docker run --rm -v /var/lib/docker:/var/lib/docker docker/v1.10-migrator
