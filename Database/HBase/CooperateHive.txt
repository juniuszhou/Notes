Hive is a MapReduce based Analysis/ Summarisation tool running on Top of Hadoop.
Hive depends on Mapreduce( Batch Processing) + HDFS

Hbase is a Database (NoSQL) - which is used to store and retrieve data.
To Query(Scans) Hbase - mapreduce is not required - So HBase depends only on HDFS
- not on Mapreduce So Hbase is Online Processing System.

the underlying implementation of hbase depends on how hbase client code to use data.
hbase just give the data partition's location and format in disc.
