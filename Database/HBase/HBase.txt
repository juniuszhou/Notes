####
hbase must cooperate with zookeeper.

each server need register to /hbase/src in znode.

## components
HMaster manage table and region
HRegion manage data provide I/O for client.

in HRegion, each table has a region, region include several store.
each store for one column family.

HStore include memstore and storefile.
memstore to buffer data in memory, flush to store file in disk after full.
when store files reach limit, the compact op will merge store file.
merge the version and delete data.

if merged store file large enough, then need region split.

HLog
WAL write ahead log, to keep data if crash.



## data storage format
HFile key value format. it is binary in HDFS. StoreFile just a wrapper on HFile.
HLogFile write ahead log for HBase.

root table and metadata table.

## HRegion
a table includes a lot of HRegions. just one at the beginning.
then be more regions if more and more data.

HRegion include several store, store just for one columns family.

store has one memStore and several StoreFile.
StoreFile 's format is HFile and exist in HDFS.


## Interface
shell, REST gateway. Thrift gateway. support java/scala, c/c++, python.



## core algorithm
LSM log structured merge tree used by HBase.

for oracle, mysql use btree.

LSM much faster for write
btree faster for read.

LSM put data into a lot of ordered block.
Bloom filter used to determine if a sorted block include the data.












## keep the column family number low
flush and compact based on region. and region can include several store / column family.
so it more than one column family, then the adjacent column family also impacted when
hbase do flush and compact for one column family.

## hbase don't support join.
## hbase support ttl
