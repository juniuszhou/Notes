Kube manage containerized application.
Kube can deploy schedule maintain and scale application.

## Concepts.
Minion: an alias to host.

service: an alias to application.

pods: run 1 to N container, containers in same pod should be located in
the same machine and share resources. pod contain 0 to N volumes.

node: node has service to run Docker and be managed by master system.

volume: directory is private to 1 to N container in a pod.

Label: key value used to distinguish pod, service and replication controller.

Kubelet: node agent which can restart container if it is down.

replication controller: to guarantee there some replicas running at any time.
like to keep the number of containers in pool.
replication controller keep the number by start/stop some container.

name space: each resource in Kube has UID and URI.
such pod has UID, and UID is an object, object's name defined in name space.
