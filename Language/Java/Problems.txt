java.lang.IncompatibleClassChangeError: Implementing class
        at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass1(Native Method)
        at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass(ClassLoader.java:800)


It means that at some point, an interface was changed to a class, but an implementer of the original interface was not modified and recompiled to accommodate this (incompatible) change.

For example, consider the following types:

interface Fooable {
  void foo();
}

class FooImpl implements Fooable {
  public void foo() {
     /* Do something... */
  }
}
Now suppose Fooable is modified and recompiled, but FooImpl is not:

abstract class Fooable {
  public abstract void foo();
}
