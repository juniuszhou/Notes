1. can't transfer to scala class if java class has internal defined enum class.
it was found when I use case class in spark to involve a thrift class generated
by thrift tool. 

Exception in thread "main" scala.reflect.internal.Symbols$CyclicReference: illegal cyclic reference involving object App

2. java.io.ObjectStreamClass.initNonProxy
if jvm vesion at running environment is not align with the package.
some strange error.

3. for scala use json.
you need define the result parsed from json string as Map[String, Object]
then transform object to specific type according to definition.

4. the specific collection can't traverse to iterable automatically.
since it just inherit the interface via "with". so you need explicitly
call toIterable for type compatibility.
