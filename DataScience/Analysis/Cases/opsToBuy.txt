opsToBuy.txt

there are many log about customer behavior both non-buy and buy.
how to determine which non-buy behavior has the most strong connection to buy.


1. it is a data mining problem ?


1. storage.
use what kind  of database to store the all ops and purchase? hase 
which one is key. user id.

keep the sequence according to timestamp. 


2. analysis.

we can take it as classification problem. logistic regression.
then each event has a weight. we can choose the most impact ones to 
send user notification.

if single op doesn't work well, we can combine the two or multiple events
to see if it is better.

## feature engineering
remove some not useful ops. like remove feature.
use PCA	etc to reduce the number of feature.
like if the goods already sent, then the ops like check logistics 
seems not useful.

## apply rules. human intercept, if needed. need when cold start.
some ops may has no effect on purchase. for example, check the shopping cart
and cart already has the goods. or check the logistics after buy.
there is no any impact if we send notification to user.

the rule is correct, maybe not, some people may buy the same goods again.
it happened like rice, oil. but not like car except buy for other people.

## clustering goods and people.
some people get little impact from outside notification. even at opposite,
think goods including promotion is bad. 

cluster goods. for example, some luxury goods never depends on promotion for sale.

## verification, if notification can really increase the purchase.
maybe from ops to purchase is very natural process.

middle process, if crease the put into cart. if the main page of goods has more opens.
matrics choose is important.
