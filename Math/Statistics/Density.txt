## gamma density.
two parameters, a and r.
a control the shape of graph. or a means how many exponential variable to sum.
if a is one, then gamma become exponential.

r control the scale of graph. r means the measure unit.
could be the second, minute or other unit.

## exponential density.
just one parameter. r control the rate of descent.

## beta density.
f(u) = gamma(a+b) / gamma(a) gamma(b) * u^a-1 * (1-u)^b-1
u is probability of happen once. then if a times positive and b times negative.
the distribution of u.
