parameterEstimate.txt

for each kind distribution, just several parameter to control its distribution.

1. moment estimation.
use the expect, variance or other moment to compare with sample moment.
and assume they should be equal if sample number big enough.
the moment of any distribution is kind of function that include several parameter as variable.

2. max likelihood estimation.
compute the multiple of each sample's probability. and make it as big as possible.

3. bayes method.
there is a prior which based on knowledge or experience. then we can set it is a condition.
