MerkeyTree.txt

merkle tree is a binary or multi branch tree.
each node contains one hash for some data.
and parent node contrains all sub data 's hash.
so it is used to compare from whole to sub-part recursively.

# if the nodes number is not the 2^n.
then some node will be repeated to compute merkle tree 's hash
