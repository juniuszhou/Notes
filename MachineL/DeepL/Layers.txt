affine layer, a fully connected layer

convolution layer, use a 3 * 3 or 5 * 5 filter to capture the feature of image.
in this layer, we may use multiple filter to process image and get activation map.
depth: how many times filter used in one dimension.
stride: how many pixel we move each time.
zero-padding: how many zero we pad at the edge of image.

relu layer. activation layer.

pool layer
this layer could output value of max or average.
a common used is max value and 2*2 size.s

full-connected layer.
