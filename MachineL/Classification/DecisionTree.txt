DecisionTree.txt

opt[Int]("maxDepth") max depth of tree.

opt[Int]("maxBins") max branch for each tree.
if too many branches then computing is slow.
we can see it is a balance between binary tree and normal decision tree.

opt[Int]("minInstancesPerNode") how many sample in each node 

opt[Double]("minInfoGain")  if info gain too small then don't split.

## other parameter just for regression.
loss function for regression
rmse or others.


so we can estimate how many node via maxBins ^ maxDepth.
