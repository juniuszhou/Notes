parsing and context free grammar

语法解析有两个主要的问题，其一是句子语法在计算机中的表达与存储方法，以及语料数据集；其二是语法解析的算法。

对于第一个问题，我们可以用树状结构图来表示，如下图所示，S表示句子；NP、VP、PP是名词、动词、介词短语（短语级别）；N、V、P分别是名词、动词、介词。

语法解析的算法。

Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar

#### PCFG
content free parsing

to create the parse tree. the 

PCFG probability content free grammar

in parse, we also can get lots of parse tree since ambigunity.
then we use probability to get the max likely one.
we give each derivation rule a value, value come from training data in supervised learning.
then multiply all derivation rule's probability we just use to get a parse tree.

chomsky algorithm
in chomsky, just two different derivation rules. that simplify the parse process.
actually, it is very similar we can get an equalent binary tree for any multi fork tree.

brute force still an almost impossible method for a long sentence.
so DP is needed.
the complexity of DP is O(len^3 * rules^3) it is not big.

the correctness rate of pure PCFG just 72%
PCFG 准确率偏低的一个主要原因是在计算每个parse tree的概率的时候，只是把
推导规则的概率简单相乘，没有考虑到每个单词的意思。而且assume单词之间是
没有关联的。这样会丢掉很多有用的信息。而人在看句子的时候会使用。

in lexicalized PCFG, each derivation rule has a head. head include a word.
so when we compute the possibility , we take the exact english word into
consideration. that's why it is much better than PCFG.
